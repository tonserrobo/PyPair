getting started

pyseed is a python based short read alignment algorithm incorporating leared index exact match seed generation. Fundamentally, 
pyseed goes through the following principle steps: 
    (1) FASTA reference and FASTQ reads are read using biopython (ref)
    (2) mapping locations from FASTQ seeds are built to a internal dictonary 
    (3) pysam [SW alignment]
To begining generating seeds and mapping them to their likly alignment locations via the seed generation model run:
    python main.py ... argvs

if the model weights are not available for your chosen geneome then you will be prompted to provide a reference.txt and name 
for your new model weights. This will invoke reference genome indexing, generation of model training data and training of the model. 
your saved weights will then be added to your project directory which can be executed. 

Generate Index

If model weights are not available for the genome you are using, you need to generate a new reference index, training data
and retrain the seed generation model. This is achieved through the following steps:
1. Generaet index:
